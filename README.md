# Network technologis university course.

l2 - creating model of computer network and testing its reliability.

Program contains implementation of connected graph topology G(V, E), where |V| = 20, |E| < 30, also functions:
- intensity flux matrix N[n(i, j)], where n(i, j) is number of transmitted packets from i to j
- bandwidth, the maximum number of bits that can be put into a communication channel
- flow the number of packets entering the channel per second

In test1 - test3 there are network reliability tests depending on:
- intensity flux matrix
- network bandwith
- number of adding edges

Report2 contains description of implementation and conclusions from the tests performed.
